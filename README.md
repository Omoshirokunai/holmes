## General info
Holmes is an image forensics tool to help detect if an image is tampered or not. Holmes uses [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) and electron as browser 

**Note**: Holmes is still early in development and missing a features and UI polish

## Available features:
* Exif viewer
* Quantization tables viewer(not yet complete)
* Error level analysis
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* python: 3.8
* streamlit
* electron: 11.1.0
	
## Setup

To run this project
1) install necessary pip libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Install necessary npm libraries

```bash
npm install electron
```
3) run streamlit

```bash
streamlit run holmes.py --server.headless true
```
4) view in electron
```bash
npm start
```

## File structure:
The current file structure will most likely be updated as I go along

holmes.py: is the main script, contains streamlit page setup and page navigation
every other module is named after what they accomplish

## TODO:
* create a list of quantization tables used by popular software and devices which will be used for matching with user uploaded image
* convolutional neural net in tensorflow that takes noise stream and rgb or ycbcr as inputs and outputs if an image is tampered or not  (top priority right now)
* i dont like how it handles the opening of images 
* imporve file structure
* script to run both streamlit and electron quickly



## Known issues:
* open file box opens behind the electron window
